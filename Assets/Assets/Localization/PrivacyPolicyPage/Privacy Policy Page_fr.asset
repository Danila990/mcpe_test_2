      is in the public domain and is intended for use by any user.\r\nThis page is
      used to inform visitors about our policies regarding the collection, use and
      disclosure of personal information.\r\n\r\nYou agree to the transfer of personal
      data to the services and SDKs that are built into our application, as well
      as the processing of files and access to the file system of your device. The
      personal data we collect will be used to provide and improve the application.
      We will not use your data or share it with third parties except as described
      in this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nThe terms used in this Privacy Policy have the
      same meaning as our terms available on the {app_name}, unless otherwise specified
      in this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n<size=120%><align=\"center\"><u>Collection and

      note that every time you use our app, in the event that an error occurs in
      the app, we transfer data and information to the Appmetrica service (through
      third party products) on your phone. This data may include information such
      as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, application
      configuration when using our Service, the time and date of use of the Service,
      and other statistical data as specified in the AppMetrica service's privacy

      automatically</u></align></size>\r\n\r\nCollecting Android Advertising IDs
      is optional. The Ad ID can be reset or removed by users using the Ad ID commands
      in the Android settings menu.\r\n \r\nCertain other features of the Google
      Mobile Ads SDK, such as the prohibited advertising feature, may also prevent
      the transmission of advertising identifiers and other data.\r\n\r\n<size=120%><align=\"center\"><u>Data

      securely handles everything personal and confidential data of users, including
      their transmission using modern cryptography (for example, via the HTTPS protocol).\r\n
      \r\nTo access the data itself, the {app_name} application requests access to
      this data from users (in exceptional cases, it does this without a request,
      indicating this in the policy of the application itself).\r\n\r\n<size=120%><align=\"center\"><u>Location.
      </u></align></size>\r\n\r\nWe do not collect data about your exact location,
      for app collection statistics we collect approximate location by your country
      and/or region of location.\r\n\r\n<size=120%><align=\"center\"><u>Files and
      Documents. </u></align></size>\r\n\r\nWe collect information about your data
      on the device that is associated with Minecraft. All data is stored temporarily.
      Users cannot prevent the collection of this data, as it is necessary for the
      application to function properly. For example, we can see if you have Minecraft
      installed or not.\r\n \r\n<size=120%><align=\"center\"><u>In-app activity history.
      </u></align></size>\r\n\r\nFor the best app experience and your experience,
      we get access to track your activities in our app, as well as collect data
      from your phone about the apps installed on it that are related to Minecraft.\r\n
